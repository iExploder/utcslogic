## Seperate the problem(Re-arrange?)

* Solving perf. problem of OCaml -> Wagon(DSL)
* Representation of C `struct`s

## Approach: Wagon

* A DSL of OCaml generates proper C code with SIMD intrinsics
  * Representation of C types
    * A "Perfect" C AST
  * Type-safe C code generator
    * Disallow implicit type casting
  * Linker info generator
    * Makes external functions callable in OCaml
* Manual SIMD Optimization
* (In roadmap) Automatic SIMD Optimization


## Problems

* Manual vectorization is used

	

Recently, architectures are well developed with SIMD(Single Instruction Multiple Data) support. However, as low-level instructions, representation of SIMD instructions in C functions (a.k.a. SIMD Intrinsics) do not hold full type information of arguments, in this case type safety can not be guaranteed. This research is to design a DSL(Domain-Specific Language) called Wagon of OCaml, to achieve automatic code generation to code with SIMD intrinsics from high-level functional programming language code, taking advantage of strong type system of OCaml. Unexperienced programmer in SIMD is desired user of Wagon.

## Fixes

* Different Integer size in Vector　ビット幅が異なる（？）
* 正しい→前述の不適切な利用が無いCコード…
* Representation of C types -> Information of Wagon itself, not detail...
