### Another Problem: Inductive Data Type in OCaml

The story from the heterogeneous list was just interrupted by
a slight - but big - problem.
That is, to achieve C-style structure representation in OCaml,
in some of the `module` implementations of `module type WagonType`
type name in string is encoded into type itself as
`'t * string` then put into a heterogeneous list.
Since the latter element in the data type is fixed(string),
exporting `struct` declaration in string could be achieved by
writing a recursive function like this...

```ocaml
(* The definition of WHList, specialized h.list for Wagon test *)
module WHList = struct
  type _ whlist =
  | WHNil  : unit whlist
  | WHCons : (('a * string) * ('b whlist)) -> (('a * string) * 'b) whlist
  let empty = WHNil
  let cons = fun a b -> WHCons(a, b)
end
```

So the recursive (simplified) export function is desired to be like

```ocaml
let rec iter_all =
fun x ->
match x with
| WHNil(_) -> ""
| WHCons((f,s), b) -> s ^ (iter_all b)
```

Unfortunately, it does not work.

```
# let rec iter_all =
fun x ->
match x with
| WHNil(_) -> ""
| WHCons((f,s), b) -> s ^ (iter_all b);;
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: This pattern matches values of type (($0 * string) * 'a) whlist
       but a pattern was expected which matches values of type unit whlist
       The type constructor $0 would escape its scope
```

So what's the problem?

I checked for the possibility of the data type of the function and searched
somewhere and I got a keyword ``Inductive Data Type".
Unfortunately, it seems not supported by OCaml yet.

**Question #1: Is this another possible plugin/extension for OCaml?**
