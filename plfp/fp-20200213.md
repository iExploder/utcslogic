## A new approach on implementing C-style `struct` in OCaml-Wagon (?)

### What does C-style `struct` need?

The current implementation of C-style `struct` in generated AST need some properties listed below.

### Requirements for **Wagon** type system

1. Any primitive **Wagon** type could be held in a `struct`
2. Type inference for making a `struct`
3. Uniformed type for primitive types and data structure types(`struct`, `array`, SIMD vectors)
4. Keep type information on accessing any element in a `struct`.

For #1 and #2, it could be easily done just by putting everything in a list, although in this case #4 cannot be satisfied(aka. `struct`s cannot be treated equally as primitive types -> putting a `struct` inside another `struct` is further more difficult).

For higher priority on implementing #3, we can encode the inside type information in ways such as hash functions, although in this case #4 cannot be satisfied since full type information just lost after declaration of a specified `struct`.

```ocaml
(* #1 & #2 *)
type structure = wtype list
(* #3 *)
type i32
type 'a pdt
type structure
type 'a wtype = string * string * int * int

val i32_t : i32 pdt wtype =
    ("int32_t", "d", 32, 32)
val structure_i32_i32 : structure wtype =
    ("wstruct_2df1xxx", "S_dd_", 64, 64)
(* Unable to keep elements' types on access! *)
```

## New Approach? : Heterogeneous List

If there were containers in which different types of elements could be accessed in a linked way (aka. iterable), in other words, **heterogeneous list**, the definition of C-style `struct`s are simpler to achieve.

Already, there is a partial solution using stacked tuples implemented by **Jane Street Group**, in a module `record_builder`.

Github repository link: https://github.com/janestreet/record_builder

Investigation of module `record_builder` shows that a heterogeneous list is implemented.

Here is a use case.

```ocaml
# let a = Hlist.empty;;
val a : unit = ()
# let b = Hlist.cons 123 a;;
val b : (int, unit) Hlist.cons = (123, ())
# let c = Hlist.cons 1.23 b;;
val c : (float, (int, unit) Hlist.cons) Hlist.cons = (1.23, (123, ()))

# let c0i = Hlist.Element_index.first_element;;
val c0i : (('a, 'b) Hlist.cons, 'a) Hlist.Element_index.t = <abstr>
# let c0t = Hlist.Element_index.of_tail c0i;;
val c0t :
  (('_weak1, ('_weak2, '_weak3) Hlist.cons) Hlist.cons, '_weak2)
  Hlist.Element_index.t = <abstr>
(* Problems come from here! *)
(* Once c0t is used, the type of c0t is statically inferred and staticalized. *)

# Hlist.nth c c0i;;
- : float = 1.23
# Hlist.nth c c0t;;
- : int = 123

# c0i;;
- : (('a, 'b) Hlist.cons, 'a) Hlist.Element_index.t = <abstr>
(* Umm, seems no problem... *)

# c0t;;
- : ((float, (int, unit) Hlist.cons) Hlist.cons, int) Hlist.Element_index.t = <abstr>
(* Bang!! c0t is no longer a general function, *)
(* but a specialized function for getting the tail of (float * (int * unit))!! *)
```

Therefore, the only way for prettily solve the problem in not a GADT(Generalized Algebraic Data type) way but a tagless-final way is probably a **ppx** extension for OCaml.

The syntax examples are shown below.

```ocaml
let v1 = [%hlist 1; 1.23; "abcde"]
type t1 = [%hlist int; float; string]
let _0 = [%wi 0] (* 1 expected *)
let _1 = [%wi 1] (* 1.23 expected *)
let _2 = [%wi 2] (* "abcde" expected *)
(* ... *)
```
produces code in
```ocaml
let v1 = (intlit i8 1, (intlit i32 10, (intlit i64 100, ())))
type t1 = i8 pdt wtype * (i32 pdt wtype * (i64 pdt wtype * unit))
let _0 = fun (a, _) -> a
let _1 = fun (_, (a, _)) -> a
let _2 = fun (_, (_, (a, _))) -> a
(* ... *)
```

### Implementation for Wagon `struct`

* Size, Special Alignment Information
* Member variables
* Detail Declaration
```c
// Example of generated struct detail declaration
struct ws_XXXX
{
    int8_t  v0;
    int32_t v1;
    int64_t v2;
};
```

For necessary information above for a Wagon `struct`,
we could provide an OCaml module `struct` declaration in form below.
Base on the ppx-based heterogeneous list plan above,
we could achieve an extended approach below.
```ocaml
(* Full typename, Abbr., Bit-length, Alignment *)
type 'a wtype = string * string * int * int

type%wstruct Ws_str1 = [%wslist i8 pdt wtype; i32 pdt wtype;  i64 pdt wtype]
```

```ocaml
module Ws_str1 = struct
  type t = {v0 : i8 pdt wtype; v1 : i32 pdt wtype; v2 : i64 pdt wtype}
  let v = {a = ("int8_t", ...); b = ...}
  let decl = "struct ..."
end
```
